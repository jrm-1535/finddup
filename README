fdup

Tool to search for (and possibly remove) duplicate files in several directories
and their sub-directories. The tool ignores file names, but checks the size
and actual content of files to determine if they are identical. It shows the
name of all duplicates found in those directories, but it can also be used to
show only duplicates for a specific target file or for all files in a target
directory.

fmis

Tool to find out which target files do not belong in several directories and
their sub-directories. The tool ignores file names, but checks the size and
actual content of files to determine if they are identical. Target can be a
single file or files in a single directory and its sub-directories.
