fdup

Tool to search for (and possibly remove) duplicate files in several directories
and their sub-directories. The tool ignores the file names, but checks the size
and actual content of files to determine if they are identical. By default it
shows all duplicates found in those directories, but it can also be used for a
specific target file or a target directory and show only duplicates for that
target or those targets.

fmis

Tool to find out which target files do not belong in given directories and
their sub-directories. The tool ignores the file names, but checks the size
and actual content of files to determine if they are identical. Target can be
a single file or files in a directory and its sub-directories.
